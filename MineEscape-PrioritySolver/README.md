# **MineEscape**

## **Overview**
MineEscape is a C++ project focused on finding the optimal escape route from a mine using weighted pathfinding algorithms. The mine is represented as a grid, with traversal costs determined by obstacles, traps, and power-ups like TNT. TNT adds a unique gameplay element through explosions that destroy surrounding blocks and can trigger chain reactions. The goal is to navigate efficiently from a start point to an end point while avoiding hazards and leveraging these dynamic elements.

The P2random files are given as starter code, but all other files are my own.

## **Skills Demonstrated**
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest pathfinding.
- **Graph Representation**: Modeled the mine as a graph with weighted edges.
- **Interactive Gameplay Design**: Integrated TNT explosions, traps, and dynamic traversal mechanics.
- **Error Handling**: Managed edge cases such as dead ends and invalid input.

## **Key Features**
- **Weighted Graph Traversal**: Accounts for traps, obstacles, and power-ups like TNT to optimize escape routes.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: TNT creates chain reactions, destroying blocks and reducing traversal costs, while traps increase costs and add strategic challenges.
