# **MineEscape**

## **Overview**
MineEscape is a C++ project focused on finding the optimal escape route from a mine using weighted pathfinding algorithms. The mine is represented as a grid, with traversal costs determined by obstacles, traps, and power-ups. The goal is to navigate from a start point to an end point efficiently while avoiding hazards and leveraging power-ups to reduce costs.

## **Skills Demonstrated**
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest pathfinding.
- **Graph Representation**: Modeled the mine as a graph with weighted edges.
- **Interactive Gameplay Design**: Developed dynamic elements such as traps and power-ups.
- **Error Handling**: Managed edge cases such as dead ends and invalid input.

## **Key Features**
- **Weighted Graph Traversal**: Accounts for traps, obstacles, and power-ups to determine the optimal escape route.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Includes interactive elements like traps (increased costs) and power-ups (reduced costs).
- **Scalability**: Supports mines of varying sizes and complexities.
