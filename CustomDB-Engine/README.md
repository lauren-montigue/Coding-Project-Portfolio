# Silly QL: A Custom Database Engine

# Overview
Silly QL is a lightweight database engine built to explore the foundational concepts of database systems, including query parsing, data storage, and retrieval. This project provides hands-on experience with how databases operate under the hood and reflects my ability to design efficient, modular systems.

# Skills Demonstrated
Database Design: Created a custom framework to execute basic SQL-like operations.
Algorithm Development: Implemented efficient query parsing and data storage mechanisms.
Programming Proficiency: Strengthened expertise in C++ and system-level design.

# Key Features
Custom query processing engine for:
Creating tables.
Inserting and retrieving data.
Filtering data with simple query syntax.
In-memory data structures for fast and efficient data access.
Modular, extensible codebase for future feature additions.

# Example Workflow
CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name TEXT);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice');
SELECT FROM users;
This query creates a table, inserts a record, and retrieves data.
