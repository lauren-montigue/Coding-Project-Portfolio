# **Coding Project Portfolio**

## **Overview**
This repository contains six projects I have completed during my coursework in Computer Science, each showcasing skills and concepts relevant to work in data science and machine learning. These projects span topics like database systems, natural language processing, and algorithm development.

While these projects are in C++, I am also proficient in Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript. Python, in particular, has been a focus in my work at United Airlines, though confidentiality agreements prevent me from sharing those projects. I have chosen projects in C++ as these projects are most relevant to work in data science.

All Makefiles were provided as part of the course. Any other files that were provided for me or part of a collaborative effort, as is the case for my Machine Learning project, are noted.

## **Contents**
Each project includes:
- **A Detailed README**: Contains a project overview, key attributes, and an example workflow.
- **Code Files**: Commented for easy understanding.
